# Welcome to my guide to trying to get into PreCog!

## Introduction

- There isn't much to give an introduction to, there are three notebooks, one for each task. 

## How To Run

- There was a slight issue in trying to upload all the datasets I used, so I uploaded them to google drive, the link for which can be [found here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GPo210fjWdpaSqFrZwQeYZnzCMPVjiXI?usp=drive_link)
- Download the concerned dataset along with the notebook.

## Directory structure required

- I was unable to download the dataset from the official website, so I downloaded it from Kaggle, the link is below. The hateful memes dataset will download as a folder named data, which I renamed to hateful_memes.
### Task 1
- Your directory should look like the following
  data  \
    |--- img\
    |--- //other files in the dataset\
    |---task1.ipynb

### Task 2
  - Your folder should look like the following\
    /data /hateful_memes task2.ipynb
### Task 3
- Your folder should look like the following\
  /fastai-v3 task3.ipynb

## Datasets Used
