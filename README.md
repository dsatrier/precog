# Welcome to my guide to trying to get into PreCog!

## Introduction

- There isn't much to give an introduction to, there are three notebooks, one for each task. 

## How To Run

- There was a slight issue in trying to upload all the datasets I used, so I uploaded them to google drive, the link for which can be [found here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GPo210fjWdpaSqFrZwQeYZnzCMPVjiXI?usp=drive_link)
- Download the concerned dataset along with the notebook.

## Directory structure required

- Run task1 from within hateful_memes
- Run task2 from within first data and then hateful_memes
- Run task3 from within fastai-v3
